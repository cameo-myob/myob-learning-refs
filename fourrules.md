# Four Rules of Simple Design

A concept originally identified by Kent Beck, the Four Rules of Simple Design outline fundamental concepts in software design. Their implementation encourages a design that will be easy to change and adapt for future uses without making everything configurable.

- Tests Pass
- Expresses Intent
- No Duplication (DRY)
- Small

## Tests Pass
Making sure the tests still pass and being able to verify that your system works 

## Expresses Intent


## No Duplication


## Small


## Examples Using Conway's Game of Life

#### Test Names Should Influence Object's API


#### Duplication of Knowledge about Topology

#### Testing State vs Testing Behaviour


#### Don't Have Tests Depend on Previous Tests


#### Breaking Abstraction Level


#### Naive Duplication
